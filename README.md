Regal is a linter for Rego, with the goal of making your Rego magnificent!

\- [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regal)

Regal rules are to as large extent as possible
[written in Rego](https://www.styra.com/blog/linting-rego-with-rego/) themselves,
using the JSON representation of the Rego abstract syntax tree (AST) as input, a
few additional custom built-in functions and some indexed data structures to help
with linting.

## Try it out!

Run `regal` pointed at one or more files or directories to have them linted:

```shell
./regal policy/
```

## Rules

This table should be generated from metadata annotations, and inserted here as part of the build process.
See: https://github.com/StyraInc/regal/issues/36

| Category   | Rule                                                                                  | Description                     | Enabled |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|
| Assignment | [use-assignment-operator](https://docs.styra.com/regal/rules/use-assignment-operator) | Prefer := over = for assignment | true    |
| Comments   | [todo-comment](https://docs.styra.com/regal/rules/todo-comment)                       | Avoid TODO comments             | true    |

## Configuration

## Development

### Building

1. Run the `build.sh` script to populate the `data` directory with any data necessary for
   linting (such as the built-in function metadata from OPA).
2. Build the `regal` executable by running `go build`.

### Testing

To run all Rego tests:

```shell
opa test policy data
```

### Authoring Rules

During development of Rego-based rules, you may want to test the policies in isolation â€” i.e. without running Regal.
Since Regal policies and data are kept in a regular
[bundle](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-bundles/) structure, this is simple. Given we want to 
test `p.rego` against the available set of rules, we can have OPA parse it and pipe the output to `opa eval` for
evaluation:

```shell
$ opa parse p.rego --format json | opa eval -f pretty -b bundle -I data.regal.main.report

      }
    ],

  }
]
```
